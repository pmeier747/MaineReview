Presents: The Invocation

An improvised play of comedy and horror.

The Invocation begins with a candle-lit ceremony and weaves an atmospheric tale. It may be filled with modern panic, gothic angst, sci-fi terror, folkloric creeps or anything in between. 

Inspired from classic horror film and television such as Tales of the Unexpected and The Twilight Zone - join us, as we clasp hands and face our fears.

Fabled is an entirely improvised fantasy adventure tale featuring a hilarious cast of improvisers with live musical accompaniment.

Improvisation is a fun yet powerful way to release your creative potential in a fun and supportive environment! On the course, we explore the basics and fundamentals of improvisation both as a performing and professional skill. The course and workshops are designed to be fun and liberating as we unlock our creativity and conquer any inhibitions or fears we harbour when presenting or communicating through improv.

In our professional and personal lives our need for connectivity, including having outlets outside of home and work, and recharging our personal and professional relationship skills is inherent to who we are. Improv is a great tool to further develop and enhance these skills.

At the end of the course, participants will grasp the fundamentals of improvisation and will be able to apply those new skills to your personal, professional and performing life. From speaking off the cuff, to bringing an edge to your presentations, improv will bring an authentic edge to all aspects of what you do!

They are not quite a class, but there is guidance. It may be worth creating a category for Drop-Ins.



Thinking about trying improv, but not sure where to start? Our bi-weekly drop-in class is a perfect way to begin your improv journey in a low-risk, supportive environment! Each Tuesday night, this one-hour drop-In Improv Class gives you an opportunity to get stage time with some professional guidance and coaching. Every week, we explore a different facet of performing improv and work on an exercise to practice a skill. Improvisers at ANY level are welcome to join.

The drop-In is your gateway to the exhilarating world of improv. In these sessions, participants are introduced to the fundamental aspects of improvisational theater in a relaxed and supportive environment.

The session structure includes ""Improv Games,"" where everyone can shake off their nerves and ignite their creativity through lively activities. Following that, the ""Scene Workouts"" allow participants to dive deep into roles, exploring narratives and the intricate interplay between characters.

Whether you're a newbie or just looking to sharpen your skills, The drop-In provides a platform to unleash your imaginative prowess and bond with fellow enthusiasts.

What is a drop-in improv class?
A drop-in class or workshop is an opportunity to get some stage time, practice, and repetitions. For our drop-ins, no improv experience is necessary, meaning the drop-in workshops don’t build off knowledge from previous workshops. The idea is that anyone can drop in any week and get a taste of what improv is like. It’s a great opportunity to see the culture and dynamic of the theater. Plus, you get to meet some members of the theater’s community in a low-pressure environment.

How does it differ from your regular classes?
Our Basic Improv Skills classes are designed to help you take your first baby steps as an improviser by introducing you to the skills you’ll need to be a successful improviser no matter what path you choose to take. We want your improv journey to be uniquely yours, so the classes can be taken in either order. Our drop-ins are newbie-friendly. But they are not structured toward a specific curriculum. Rather, they are designed to get you onstage doing scenes in a supportive environment. Our coaches generally work on a specific skill each night and craft the workshop toward honing that skill.

What should I wear?
Wear comfortable, stage-appropriate clothes. Meaning something that you would feel comfortable wearing if you had to sit in a chair on an elevated stage, roll on the ground, jump in the air, or crawl like a snake.

What should I say?
Don’t be afraid to strike up a conversation with the other folks there. It’s okay to be the new person, and the other folks at the drop-in will likely be thrilled that you’re joining them. There’s nothing wrong with telling someone it’s your first time at the drop-in and asking them questions about the format.

What will be expected of me?
Nothing will probably be expected of you. You’re not going to be forced into doing anything you don’t want to do. You will, however, be encouraged to participate. What that participation entails depends largely on the structure of the drop-in. At ours, we work mostly on two-person scenes. You might want to watch a couple of reps from some of the veterans of the drop-in first before going onstage.

Should I just show up?
YUP. And try to show up on time in case there is any instruction prior to the workshop starting. Improvisers are welcoming creatures, and whoever is running the drop-in should facilitate an awesome environment for getting your feet wet in improv. For a lot of drop-ins (including ours), you’re more than welcome to “audit” a workshop to get the lay of the land before jumping into the deep end.

Give it a shot. The beauty of a drop-in is that—even if it’s not your scene—you can just choose to not do it again. There’s little to no commitment. You have nothing to lose.",https://www.meetup.com/ennis-improv-meetup-group/events/303647743/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events

The essence of comedic acting

What is a drop-in improv class?
A drop-in class or workshop is an opportunity to get some stage time, practice, and repetitions. For our drop-ins, no improv experience is necessary, meaning the drop-in workshops don’t build off knowledge from previous workshops. The idea is that anyone can drop in any week and get a taste of what improv is like. It’s a great opportunity to see the culture and dynamic of the theater. Plus, you get to meet some members of the theater’s community in a low-pressure environment.
How does it differ from your regular classes?

Our Basic Improv Skills classes are designed to help you take your first baby steps as an improviser by introducing you to the skills you’ll need to be a successful improviser no matter what path you choose to take. We want your improv journey to be uniquely yours, so the classes can be taken in either order. Our drop-ins are newbie-friendly. But they are not structured toward a specific curriculum. Rather, they are designed to get you onstage doing scenes in a supportive environment. Our coaches generally work on a specific skill each night and craft the workshop toward honing that skill.

What should I wear?
Wear comfortable, stage-appropriate clothes. Meaning something that you would feel comfortable wearing if you had to sit in a chair on an elevated stage, roll on the ground, jump in the air, or crawl like a snake.

What should I say?
Don’t be afraid to strike up a conversation with the other folks there. It’s okay to be the new person, and the other folks at the drop-in will likely be thrilled that you’re joining them. There’s nothing wrong with telling someone it’s your first time at the drop-in and asking them questions about the format.

What will be expected of me?
Nothing will probably be expected of you. You’re not going to be forced into doing anything you don’t want to do. You will, however, be encouraged to participate. What that participation entails depends largely on the structure of the drop-in. At ours, we work mostly on two-person scenes. You might want to watch a couple of reps from some of the veterans of the drop-in first before going onstage.

Should I just show up?
YUP. And try to show up on time in case there is any instruction prior to the workshop starting. Improvisers are welcoming creatures, and whoever is running the drop-in should facilitate an awesome environment for getting your feet wet in improv. For a lot of drop-ins (including ours), you’re more than welcome to “audit” a workshop to get the lay of the land before jumping into the deep end.

Give it a shot. The beauty of a drop-in is that—even if it’s not your scene—you can just choose to not do it again. There’s little to no commitment. You have nothing to lose.",https://www.meetup.com/ennis-improv-meetup-group/events/304422186/

A drop-in class or workshop is an opportunity to get some stage time, practice, and repetitions. For our drop-ins, no improv experience is necessary, meaning the drop-in workshops don’t build off knowledge from previous workshops. The idea is that anyone can drop in any week and get a taste of what improv is like. It’s a great opportunity to see the culture and dynamic of the theater. Plus, you get to meet some members of the theater’s community in a low-pressure environment.
How does it differ from your regular classes?

Our Basic Improv Skills classes are designed to help you take your first baby steps as an improviser by introducing you to the skills you’ll need to be a successful improviser no matter what path you choose to take. We want your improv journey to be uniquely yours, so the classes can be taken in either order. Our drop-ins are newbie-friendly. But they are not structured toward a specific curriculum. Rather, they are designed to get you onstage doing scenes in a supportive environment. Our coaches generally work on a specific skill each night and craft the workshop toward honing that skill.

What should I wear?
Wear comfortable, stage-appropriate clothes. Meaning something that you would feel comfortable wearing if you had to sit in a chair on an elevated stage, roll on the ground, jump in the air, or crawl like a snake.

What should I say?
Don’t be afraid to strike up a conversation with the other folks there. It’s okay to be the new person, and the other folks at the drop-in will likely be thrilled that you’re joining them. There’s nothing wrong with telling someone it’s your first time at the drop-in and asking them questions about the format.

What will be expected of me?
Nothing will probably be expected of you. You’re not going to be forced into doing anything you don’t want to do. You will, however, be encouraged to participate. What that participation entails depends largely on the structure of the drop-in. At ours, we work mostly on two-person scenes. You might want to watch a couple of reps from some of the veterans of the drop-in first before going onstage.

Should I just show up?
YUP. And try to show up on time in case there is any instruction prior to the workshop starting. Improvisers are welcoming creatures, and whoever is running the drop-in should facilitate an awesome environment for getting your feet wet in improv. For a lot of drop-ins (including ours), you’re more than welcome to “audit” a workshop to get the lay of the land before jumping into the deep end.

Give it a shot. The beauty of a drop-in is that—even if it’s not your scene—you can just choose to not do it again. There’s little to no commitment. You have nothing to lose.",https://www.meetup.com/ennis-improv-meetup-group/events/304422186/

Thinking about trying improv, but not sure where to start? Our bi-weekly drop-in class is a perfect way to begin your improv journey in a low-risk, supportive environment! Each Tuesday night, this one-hour drop-In Improv Class gives you an opportunity to get stage time with some professional guidance and coaching. Every week, we explore a different facet of performing improv and work on an exercise to practice a skill. Improvisers at ANY level are welcome to join.

The drop-In is your gateway to the exhilarating world of improv. In these sessions, participants are introduced to the fundamental aspects of improvisational theater in a relaxed and supportive environment.
The session structure includes ""Improv Games,"" where everyone can shake off their nerves and ignite their creativity through lively activities. Following that, the ""Scene Workouts"" allow participants to dive deep into roles, exploring narratives and the intricate interplay between characters.

Formats: Twoprov, French Braid, Montage, Monoscene
Skills: Mutli-character scenes, edits, monologues, pacing, physicality, variety & dynamism

Paul Mone is the founder and Creative Director of Belfast Improv. You may have seen him perform at Gather or Improv Fest, or taken an online class with him. Paul loves characters, and is extremely wary of narratives - especially those that we impose on ourselves as perfomers.

No Compromises

Do you have Improv Imposter Syndrome?

Good news! You're not alone!
Bad news! We all hide it so well that we never end up getting past it.

The No Compromises workshop gives you a framework of thinking about improv that will allow you to dispel the voices that tell you you're not enough. By the end of the workshop you'll find yourself making bolder decisions, creating more interesting characters, and feeling a lot better about yourself as a performer!

This workshop is for you if you're afraid of 'breaking' a scene or generally not being good enough. You're good enough - I promise.

..............................................................

Keeping Up Appearances

You're a few minutes into your scene, you've made some bold choices, and you're having fun - for now. Your brain is about to remind you that you don't know where the scene is going and then you'll descend into panic and judgment.

In this workshop, we're going to practice 'keeping up appearances' - finding out what makes our characters tick do that we can keep going for longer.

This workshop is for you if you've ever worried mid-scene about where it's going, or you're in a scene that you're not enjoying and want to make it more fun for yourself.",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/no-compromises-dublin-workshop-tickets-1088799672129
