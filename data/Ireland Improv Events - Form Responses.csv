Presents: The Invocation

An improvised play of comedy and horror.

The Invocation begins with a candle-lit ceremony and weaves an atmospheric tale. It may be filled with modern panic, gothic angst, sci-fi terror, folkloric creeps or anything in between. 

Inspired from classic horror film and television such as Tales of the Unexpected and The Twilight Zone - join us, as we clasp hands and face our fears.


Fabled (UK)
The Improvised Fantasy Adventure

Hark! Who goes there?! Is that Hark? HARK!

Gather 'round, weary travellers. Sit thine bottoms and open thy ears to a story so improvised, so fantasy, so...adventure...that it will feel as if you have failed a wisdom saving throw against a Charm Person spell.

Fabled is an entirely improvised fantasy adventure tale featuring a hilarious cast of improvisers with live musical accompaniment.

Grab a stool at the Fabled Tavern and join us on our quest. Maybe bring a friend— after all, it's dangerous to go alone!
